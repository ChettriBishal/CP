/*
 * hello @bishal_c
 * log2(N&(-N)) +1 will give u position of first set bit (counting from right and 1 based indexing .
 * if n is a positive number , so -n will be a negative number and negative number are represented in 2â€™s compliment
 * ,which is ~n+1 , ~n has all the bits of n inverted due to which we get 0 in place of 1 and vice versa so when we add
 * 1 to ~n then that 1 occupies the first rightmost 0 in (~n)(which is same as rightmost 1 value in n) and other bits
 * have inverted values or zero values . so when we perform & operation we get only rightmost bit set in the function
 * ,and then we perform logn (base2) to get corresponding index.
 *
 * eg :- n = 1110010100
 * ~n= 0001101011
 * ~n+1=-n= 0001101100
 * (n&(-n))= 0000000100 = 4
 * log(4) =2
 * 2+1=3 which is the answer
 *
